### Known Issues ###
Plugin hasn't been tested yet in many cases. So I would be grateful for any feedback.

### Getting started ###

    var searcher = jQuery("#searchSelector").search(options);

Method "search" of jQuery object returns "searcher" object, which is used for search.

### Options of plugin ###

    //print debug information into console
    "debug" : false,
    
    //in case of false searcher after creating call nextConcurrence method
    //if you would like to do some other stuff, please use onCreate callback
    "createOnly" : true,
    
    //if it is set,then search result will be always always updated in context container
    "searchSelector" : "",
    
    //start postion
    //NOTE:
    //1. position starts with 0.
    //2. if you call nextConcurrence method, it will be increased before finding element
    "position" : -1,
    
    //search of order
    // can be "up" (or true), "down" (or false)
    "searchOrder" : "down",
    
    //type of finding behaviour
    // can be:
    // 1. highlight - highlight whole element
    // 2. highlightSelected - highlight selected text of element
    // 3. replace - replace 
    // 4. none - do not do anything, usefull with afterSearch callback
    "searchType" : "highlight",
    
    //text to search. can be set via setText method
    "text" : null,
    
    //text to replace (when "searchType" is "replace" only
    "replaceBy" : "",
    
    //if this parameter is true, page automatically scroll to selected element
    //NOTE: it might not work in case if selector is different than needed, use afterSearch callback in that case
    "scrollTo" : false,
    
    //callback called after creating of "searcher" object
    onCreate : function(){},
    
    //calback called before next search
    beforeSearch : function(){},
    
    //callback called after next search
    afterSearch : function(textEl){}
